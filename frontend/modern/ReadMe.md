## Theaming
ThemeProvider component is used in order to inject a theme into the application. However, this is optional; Material-UI components come with a default theme.

ThemeProvider relies on the context feature of React to pass the theme down to the components, so you need to make sure that ThemeProvider is a parent of the components you are trying to customize. You can learn more about this in the API section.
